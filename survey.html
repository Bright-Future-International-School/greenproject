            <h2>Conducted Survey Among the Public & Students</h2>
            <p> This survey was conducted based on Sustainability & Greenery in Qatar. 
                We've asked Age Groups between 17-20 and 30-45 about what they think about 
                Qatar taking the steps to embrace sustainability and bring it within the 
                country and community, in the peoples' daily lives and the environment which 
                surround us. We've spoke with people around the public, teachers and even 
                students, about their familiarity with Qatar's Vision 2023 for Sustainability 
                and these were the results of our research.
